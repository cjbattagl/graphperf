Approximate Graph Traversals -- Minimizing Energy
Skip nodes that have probability of returning already-visited neighbors.
Social graphs should be more tolerant of this?

0. Recognize the more power-consuming aspects of graph traversal. (Obv things that result in communication). 
1. Define a metric of correctness (QoS) of a SSSP result (i.e, difference of distance vector).
2. Sample the exact results vs. results with nodes removed. Remove nodes from following distributions: a. uniform random b. random across degrees c. only from low degree c. random across betw. centrality d. only from low betw. centrality
3. Nodes with high betw. centrality are clearly the worst to skip over. Can we use a heuristic to recognize these during computation? (i.e Bader, et al have approx betw centrality).
